This plugin allows you to load more comments instantly via a button push (AJAX), instead of pagination that reloads the page.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that uses AJAX to load comments, converting the "Newer/Older Comments" button into a button that loads more comments instantly.

This plugin also paginates nested replies. You can customize styling in whatever way you choose.

Using Settings > Comment Load More, user can set desired pagination (currently both comments and replies have the same number).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Comment Load More screen to configure your pagination.
